# Changelog

This changelog lists all notable updates to the CoreBootstrap framework, in reverse chronological order. It adheres to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) of the original Bootstrap framework. CoreBootstrap versions are equal to theirs. Versions older than 4.4.0 are available, but not logged.

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes to documentation, fixing grammar and other small updates are common practice in every release, so they aren't mentioned in this changelog. Important (breaking) changes are, if needed inside alerts.

> [!TIP]  
> PrePros constantly updates its `prepros.config` settings file, so it has been exluded in `.gitignore`. These settings are however made available in the `prepros-backup.config`, which will be updated sporadically when those new settings are needed in your projects.
