# CoreBootstrap

A few years ago, I build CoreBootstrap for my own website projects. I needed a quick and easy method to up- or even downgrade between the different versions of Twitter Bootstrap, without having to constantly make changes in some command-line prompt.

As a designer, I've always disliked the flat and sometimes unneeded over-complicated command-line messages. I want to use a simple and visual pleasing interface. I previously used a combination of different software to compile (WinLess), reload (LiveReload) and later use other tools to choose to minify or even uglify code. These days I just use PrePros, which does it all.

## Pre-compiled
CoreBootstrap consists of clean downloads of almost all LESS and Sass versions of Twitter Bootstrap. A lot of my projects include commonly used mixin libraries, so I also included FontAwesome and LessHat in the CoreBootstrap compilation.

On top of these frameworks, you load your own settings and compile all that to the final version of your CSS.

Its happened to me twice that I needed to switch to an older version of Bootstrap, to make things work. The only thing I needed to do in my own CoreBootstrap framework, was to switch a single number, ie 3.3.5 to 3.3.4, and recompile the code. Thats a few seconds of work.

## GitHub Repository
I'm new to GitHub. I'm learning. I've decided to release my CoreBootstrap to other developers. Feel free to create additional code, expand on it. And help me learn more about Git and GitHub.

If all else fails, I still host a downloadable version on my online test environment. If you want to download a full version in a ZIP file, check out the following website: http://www.testingoursite.com/bootstrap/ 

## MIT Licence
I'm also new to licensing. Since Twitter Bootstrap itself is released under a MIT License, I've released my CoreBootstrap under the same, in good faith. No copyright infringement intended.
