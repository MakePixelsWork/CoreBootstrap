# Template images use their own folder!

Its a good practice to keep all template related images seperated from the content graphics, photos and other supporting materials used in your main website.

This way you have one central place you can store all your  optimized template images and reference them close to your (compiled) CSS code. 

All the other dynamic content, which changes over the years can be added to its own images folders, either in the root of the website, or as images in their own page folders.

## Best practice

After 20 years of programming websites, the following little guide has proven itself over and over again. Its a 'best practice' of sorts... so feel free to apply it to your website structure. But if you know a better way that works for you, go with that!

Some rules I set myself:

    - Sort images by function > see below!
    - Use short names > which comes handy when coding
    - Always use English > so everyone understands
    - Never use spaces > add a hyphen (-) for all spaces
    - Always use lower-case letters > so don't use CamelCase


## Use short names, sort by function and -if needed- add specs

Images within websites have their own function. It could be a logo, a banner, a photo, an animated-gif, a repeating background, an icon, etc.

Their function is often leading. But a programmer doesn't want to constantly describe them that way. Why would you want an image to be called 'Background footer Large.png' when you can also write 'bg-footer-lg.png'? Writing everyhing in lower-case is also easier and faster.

After a while you will start to recognise these short naming conventions. Just like with t-shirts, you probably know what sizes thise buttons are: bt-xl / bt-lg / bt-md / bt-sm / bt-xs ?! ;).

You can apply this naming convention to a lot of well know web formats:

    animated gif = ag
    background = bg
    banner = bn
    button = bt (or btn, like Bootstrap uses)
    footer = ft
    header = hd
    icon = ic
    logo = lg
    photo = ph

Examples that are descriptive, but still short:

    ag-btn-add-to-basket.gif
    bn-shop-landingpage-id2020-09-30a.jpg
    bt-shop-cta-buy-now.png
    bg-menu-left.png
    bg-profile-photo.png
    hd-main-intro.jpg
    ic-twitter.png

Or combinations that need to be together, like a set of social icons:

    ic-social-facebook.png
    ic-social-linkedin.png
    ic-social-twitter.png
    ic-social-whatsapp.png 

Or seperate version of your logo, in Large and Small sizes:

    lg-core-bootstrap-lg.png
    lg-core-bootstrap-sm.png

## Don't overdo it!

Don't get crazy and shorten all the words... or no-one will understand what you meant. Each website is different and could have influence on the naming-convention as well as its file and folder structure.

If you have hundreds or even thousands of photos to share, you may need to think about applying the naming-convention on its folder structure. 

Got a site with hundreds of pages, each with their own banner? Then I would place all of them in their own 'banner' folder. This is easier to recognise and order. You can alwys sort them inside the folder with your own system.

## Why no underscores as seperators?

Its bad practice, especially for SEO purposes. But for SEO it would even be better if your wrote out all your images. But for your template this is never needed. You can apply several more SEO rules to images for your final content. Go crazy. But keep your template images folder clean!
