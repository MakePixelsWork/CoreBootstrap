# Samples files for your builds

Some Bootstrap versions have subtle differences in the way they are compiled. While its evident there are differences between v4 and v5, there are however also differences between v5.1.3 and v.5.2.0+. The team of Bootstrap often add something that changes how the compiler works.

To make it as easy as possible, I've made folders that contain each and every version of the Bootstrap build scripts, as well as their starter template equivalent.

## Builders folder
This folder contains the 'build' scripts needed to compile LESS or SASS to its CSS equivalent. Just copy the code of your preferred version into their respective 'styles-less.less' or 'styles-sass.scss' files, so your compiler knows what to do.

## HTML folder
This folder contains the starter templates for each version of Bootstrap. These are examples of how Bootstrap is used inside your HTML. Where Bootstrap v3 and v4 relied on jQuery to run, v5 no longer has that dependency.
