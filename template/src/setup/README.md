# Samples files for your builds

## Builders
These are the 'build scripts' needed to compile LESS or SASS to its CSS equivalent. Just copy the code of your preferred version into their respective 'styles-less.less' or 'styles-sass.scss' files, so your compiler knows what to do.

### Why?
Each version of either precompiler often has subtle differences between the way things are compiled. There aren't only changed between v4 and v5... but also changes v5.1.3 and v.5.2.0 and above. To be on the safe-side...I've included compilers for all versions.

## HTML Starter Templates
These are just examples of how Bootstrap is used inside your HTML. Again, for easy reference, I've included a template for each possible version.
