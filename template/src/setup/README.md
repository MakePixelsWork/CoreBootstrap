# Samples files for your builds

## Builders
These are the 'build' scripts needed to compile LESS or SASS to its CSS equivalent. Just copy the code of your preferred version into their respective 'styles-less.less' or 'styles-sass.scss' files, so your compiler knows what to do.

**Why**<br>
Some Bootstrap versions have subtle differences in the way they are compiled. While its evident there are differences between v4 and v5, there are however also differences between v5.1.3 and v.5.2.0+. The team of Bootstrap added something new and now the compiler changed.

To make it as easy as possible to change versions, I made builds available for all of them.

## HTML Starter Templates
These are examples of how Bootstrap is used inside your HTML. Where Bootstrap v3 and v4 relied on jQuery to run, v5 no longer has that dependency.

Again, for easy reference, I've included a template for each possible version.
